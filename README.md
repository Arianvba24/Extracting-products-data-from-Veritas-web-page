# Extracting-products-data-from-Veritas-web-page
Hi mates.

In this project what we are going to do is extract the data and images of an organic supermarketplace that is very known in Spain.

We can see in the first place that the data is not completly available. We must push a button in order to get more data:

<img width="815" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/895e5b18-a9f1-4caa-b6af-79f47f7d7c88">

So we are going to use Playwright to execute the Javascript function that deploys more data every time we push the button untill the button dissapears:
